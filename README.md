## ðŸ“– Description

**Bile Mo API** is an API for a company specializing in the sale of high-end mobile phones, providing access to its catalog through a B2B (Business to Business) interface. <br>
Access to the API is restricted to registered clients who must authenticate via a JWT token. Data is exposed in JSON format, following levels 1, 2, and 3 of the Richardson model. <br>
Responses are cached to improve query performance.
